TeaMo: A Team Simulator
=======================

After spending 5 days in Barcelona, a couple from Hannibal, Missouri decided that there
was much money to be made creating Te Amo, a dating website for Spaniards. They put their life
savings towards renting a shiny office, and enticed some local developers with the promise of
free tea.

Unsurprisingly, the founder's lack of knowledge of the Spanish heart led to poor adoption, and
the business was about to fail. With Te Amo at its last legs, the founders called for a company-wide
meeting to try to rescue the company. The situation was bleak: according to the developers, the only
valuable assets of the company were a domain name and the free tea.

There was only one way out: a pivot. With a small change in the logo, Te Amo became Tea Mo, the
premier online tea purveyor in Missouri.
